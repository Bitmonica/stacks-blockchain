Blockstack Core API
=========

This is the Blockstack REST API (under development) 

The goal here is to consolidate various Blockstack services, like resolver
and search, into a single server and provide a RESTful API access in addition
to the RPC interface of Blockstack Core.

We'll update this README when the Core API gets more defined.
