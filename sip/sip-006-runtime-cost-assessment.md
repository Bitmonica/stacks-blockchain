## Abstract

This document describes the measured costs and asymptotic costs
assessed for the execution of Clarity code. This will not specify the
_constants_ associated with those asymptotic cost functions. Those
constants will necessarily be measured via benchmark harnesses and
regression analyses. Furthermore, the _analysis_ cost associated with
this code will not be covered by this proposal.
