### Is there a mechanism to store encrypted data?

Not in this software. Simply encrypt your file, then submit that data.

### Can't someone just store huge files in the DHT?

Yes.

### Aren't DHTs vulnerable to sybil attacks?

Yes. Unfortunately like Bitcoin and other systems, sybil attacks are possible. That said, we're working on ways to severely minimize the risks of this.

### Can nodes just pop in and out and confuse the network?

Kind of.

### Is there any incentive to run a node?

Not currently, no.

### Is there a layer on top of the DHT that can make it simple to grab the data?

We plan on caching all the data in the DHT and providing easy access to the data through an API

### Can I build and host my own index/cache of the data in the DHT?

Absolutely! Anyone can.
