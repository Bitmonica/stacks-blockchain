Beta at Aug. 15.  Should be as close-to-ready as possible 
Announce on Sept. 1.
Summit on Sept. 12.

* revoke operation

* move to pybitcoin

Blockstack is the interface to the "packages" namespace 
* pip install blockstack
* blockstack install blockchain_id 
--> fetches blockchain_id python package from the user account "blockchain_id.packages" (i.e. there is a packages namespace)--i.e., the package zip file is in mutable storage tied to "blockchain_id.packages"

* move off of chain.com

* transfer will blow away old data (e.g. from the profile)

Storage
* blockstore-cli --> high-level client-side API library, with CLI wrapper

Migration plan:
* null namespace has to be "imported" with NAMESPACE_DEFINE
* namespace owner (us) puts all names in place, as NAME_REGISTER operations 
* namespace owner (us) sends each name to the public key of the name owner (i.e. pubkey in namecoin to be converted to the pubkey in bitcoin)
* namespace owner (us) writes NAMESPACE_BEGIN

* need to create a 'packages' namespace'

API plan:
* https://github.com/blockstack/blockstore/issues/100

Microsoft hack-a-thon
* user is authoritative source of their data; other processes write to it with the user's permission
* create user agents that run as delegates of the user
* profile --> Syndicate Volume
* user allows other programs to write to a subset of the profile (i.e. permissioned mounts in Syndicate), can revoke 
* user (or agent) updates it periodically (e.g. uber driver's agent writes their location to their profile; uber indexes)
* web apps serve and run agents, and index other users' data with users' permissions
